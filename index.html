    <p><span data-actor="harry">Harry: No, Ron! No!</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="hermione">Hermione: What is it?</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="harry">Harry: He's going to sacrifice himself!</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="hermione">Hermione: No, Ron, you can't! [Ron closes his eyes.] There must be another way!</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="ron">Ron: [Turns to face Hermione.] Do you want to stop Snape or not? Harry, it's you that has to go on. I know it. Not me, not Hermione, you. [Harry nods.]Knight...to H-3.</span></p>
    <p>[Ron's horse moves forward, slides and stops.]</p>
    <p><span data-actor="ron">Ron:Check.</span></p>
    <p>[The Queen turns and advances. Ron breathes faster, clutching the steel reins. The Queen stops. SMASH! Ron goes flying off the horse and lands on the floor, unconscious.]</p>  
    <p><span data-actor="ron">Ron: Ahhhh!</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="harry">Harry: RON! [Hermione starts walking to him.] NO! Don't move! Dont forget, we're still playing. [Hermione moves back. Harry walks the diagonal in front of the King.] Checkmate. [The Kings sword falls onto the ground victory. Harry breathes out and then the two run to Ron. They bend beside him.] Take care of Ron. Then, go to the owlery. Send a message to Dumbledore. Ron's right...I have to go on.</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="hermione">Hermione: You'll be okay, Harry. You're a great wizard, you really are.</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="harry">Harry: Not as good as you.</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="hermione">Hermione: [smile] Me? Books and cleverness? There are more important things. Friendship, and bravery. And Harry, just be careful.</span></p>
    <p>Harry nods and stands, walking away.</p>
